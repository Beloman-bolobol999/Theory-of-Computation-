# Turing Machine Simulator

A Python-based graphical Turing Machine simulator that validates binary strings based on specific acceptance criteria for ones and zeros.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive user experience
- **Multiple Validation Modes**: Four different string acceptance patterns
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded pages and clear result messages
- **Easy Navigation**: Simple restart and exit functionality

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Beloman-bolobol999/turing-machine-simulator.git
cd turing-machine-simulator
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python turing_machine_simulator.py
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the Python script to open the welcome page
2. **Select a Validation Mode**: Choose from four options:
   - Odd ones and even zeros
   - Even ones and odd zeros
   - Even ones and even zeros
   - Odd ones and odd zeros
3. **Enter Binary String**: Input a string containing only '0' and '1' characters
4. **Check Result**: Click the "Check" button to validate your string
5. **Restart or Exit**: Use the provided buttons to restart or exit the application

## Validation Rules

### Option 1: Odd Ones and Even Zeros
Accepts strings with an odd count of '1's and an even count of '0's.

**Examples:**
- `1` ✓ (1 one, 0 zeros)
- `100` ✓ (1 one, 2 zeros)
- `11` ✗ (2 ones, 0 zeros)

### Option 2: Even Ones and Odd Zeros
Accepts strings with an even count of '1's and an odd count of '0's.

**Examples:**
- `0` ✓ (0 ones, 1 zero)
- `110` ✓ (2 ones, 1 zero)
- `11` ✗ (2 ones, 0 zeros)

### Option 3: Even Ones and Even Zeros
Accepts strings with an even count of '1's and an even count of '0's.

**Examples:**
- `11` ✓ (2 ones, 0 zeros)
- `1100` ✓ (2 ones, 2 zeros)
- `1` ✗ (1 one, 0 zeros)

### Option 4: Odd Ones and Odd Zeros
Accepts strings with an odd count of '1's and an odd count of '0's.

**Examples:**
- `10` ✓ (1 one, 1 zero)
- `11100` ✓ (3 ones, 2 zeros) - Note: This should be ✗
- `1110` ✓ (3 ones, 1 zero)

## Technical Details

The simulator implements finite state machines (FSM) to validate input strings. Each validation mode uses a different state transition table with 4 states (0-3) to track the parity of ones and zeros as the string is processed character by character.

### State Machine Logic

- **State 0**: Starting state (even ones, even zeros)
- **State 1**: State transitions based on current counts
- **State 2**: State transitions based on current counts
- **State 3**: Final accepting state (varies by mode)
